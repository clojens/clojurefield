* ClojureScript browser connected REPL
** send cljs compiler output to the browser to be evaluated
** send results back to the command line process to be printed
** side effects happen in the browser
** abstract communication away using goog library
*** Goog abstraction for websockets? Ideal!
*** Polling? It will work everywhere.
*** Ideally an abstraction over both that prefers websockets but doesn't fail and doesn't complain loudly.
** evaluation daemon for the browser
** launch browser
** transparent update of bound symbols? We should test.
** brepl has its own solution for deps, we'd like to tie into the ClojureScript dependency story
** require mechanisms are out; the source that forms the repl's environment will need to be updated and the page reloaded
